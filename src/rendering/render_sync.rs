//! THE ONLY FILE THAT CONVERTS f64 SimPosition → f32 Transform.
//!
//! No other file in this codebase is allowed to perform this conversion. Ever.
//!
//! # Why this file exists
//!
//! Simulation positions are stored as [`SimPosition`] (f64 [`DVec3`]) relative to the
//! current [`LocalOrigin`]. f32 only has ~7 significant digits of precision — at planetary
//! scale (~10^7 metres from a body centre) that leaves roughly 1 metre of precision, which
//! is completely unacceptable for a spacecraft sim.
//!
//! The safe conversion pattern is:
//! 1. Subtract [`LocalOrigin`] from the simulation position **while still in f64**.
//!    The result is a small relative value (the entity is near the local origin by design).
//! 2. **Only then** cast to f32. The small magnitude means the cast preserves full
//!    sub-millimetre precision.
//!
//! If you find yourself writing `.as_vec3()` or `as f32` outside of this file, stop.
//! You are in the wrong place. Add a note to the PR explaining why and get it reviewed.
//!
//! # Coordinate spaces (summary — full spec in design.md)

//! SIMULATION WORLD (f64 DVec3, relative to WorldOrigin)
//!       ↓  render_sync.rs ONLY — subtract LocalOrigin, then cast to f32
//! RENDER WORLD (f32 Vec3, Bevy Transform — what the GPU sees)
//! ```
//!
//! [`LocalOrigin`] tracks the render-space origin (kept near the active vessel).
//! [`WorldOrigin`] tracks the simulation-space origin in solar-inertial f64 coordinates.
//! Krakensbane shifts both when the active vessel drifts too far from the current origin.
